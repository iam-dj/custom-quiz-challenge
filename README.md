Building a quiz with CSS, HTML, & JS

## Description

Building a work day schduler with multiple areas to submit text will keep you on top of tasks. It's color coded to see what you need to get done and what's passed.

This project allowed me to test my coding knowledge and skills, and to practice solving coding problems. Additionally, it was fun. It did help me identify areas to improve such as local storage, linking third parties, and JQuery syntax.

## Installation

No installation needed.

## Usage

head to this link: https://iam-dj.github.io/fifth-challenge  and submit the tasks you want to get done at the specific hours and hit save.
